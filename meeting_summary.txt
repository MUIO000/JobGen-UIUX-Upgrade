[30] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[31] You:
    URL, and this is the screen shot and the what? I like it and the inspiration for Job genia like this and yeah, it's all good.

[32] Kush Bhatia:
    I think the way I wanted to think about this is good. This is very but think about we have to give to a guide to design a page like not design build a page.

[33] You:
    It. But yeah, no. Okay.

[34] Kush Bhatia:
    So this guy like a builder, right? A developer. So think about what you can give is just a screenshots you know, like so each page will have number of sections, right? So remember the ice, I shared one document with you, if you mind opening

[35] You:
    Yeah.

[36] Kush Bhatia:
    that document,

[37] You:
    Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

[38] Kush Bhatia:
    And Lucas again. I'm seriously. Very sorry, I don't know.

[39] You:
    No rest. No. No guys to

[40] Kush Bhatia:
    I even the last meeting in time to meet with you completely,

[41] You:
    Yeah. Okay. Like this this one, right?

[42] Kush Bhatia:
    This is the content, right? So there's another document, the dog.

[43] You:
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hero session and

[44] Kush Bhatia:
    No, no, there's another one with images. Do you have that document?

[45] You:
    Oh, that's Autom. Yeah, this one. Yeah.

[46] Kush Bhatia:
    I mean Lucas, yes. So something I was thinking like this. So think about you go to all the website, create what one document where you dump the, you know, the

[47] You:
    document and what you can do. If you see there's a vision one, You just click on that. You're not like, it's yeah. Like, do you see that globe at the bottom, the group, you know, keep on going. Keep on going down. You like

[48] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah. Yeah. Difficult going down.

[49] You:
    means like, um, so think about like this, right? They are five six sections. I put so question, if you go up there, the team section, then there's a founder

[50] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah. Yeah.

[51] You:
    section. So, if you keep on going up, you know, scroll up. So there's a founder section, then who we are and then little bit about, just a team image. I was thinking maybe we can put a whole team photograph on the top and then,

[52] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay.

[53] You:
    thing, you know, we can talk about a little bit of our product as you can see in the middle, then we say, who we are kind of

[54] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[55] You:
    You are not but this one need the mind behind it. So it could be found this photograph or the team photograph we can have and this will be the more detailed team, right? Like, you know, different pillars and all this stuff we can put and then the bottom one. And we need your photograph in there as well.

[56] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay. Okay, no problem, no problem. Okay, yeah.

[57] You:
    And this one. So this is what I think Lucas and you know give me something like

[58] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it. So okay.

[59] You:
    this or that I can dump it to the person and then he can, you know,

[60] Kush Bhatia:
    So I just finished in this format, right? And I will give it to this night tonight. Alright, I did by the

[61] You:
    Oh yeah.

[62] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay. So, here's my UI US design report. Okay, who is per second? Maybe. Yeah. Okay.

[63] You:
    And Lucas, I want another quick favor as well, you know. So this one

[64] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay.

[65] You:
    So, think about there's another one called Partnership Page, right?

[66] Kush Bhatia:
    Partnership page. Okay.

[67] You:
    But like we have about this. Similarly we need another page called Partnership Page which again you need to just take a screenshot. That's all you need to do

[68] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[69] You:
    Partnership page and then you're not like that guy will do and then you can refine it and then we can always find Tuneage visiting a UX design specialist regulation. The part we need is so think about when we are working on Job Gen. There's a lot of people who want to work with us for example career coaches. So we want to, you're not create a page where we basically recommend other businesses, like Cross collaboration, right? So it's called partners or partnership and then we say Jobs in is very proudly partnering with these and you say career coaches. So you can have like our top menu bar, you know, like like not the top top menu bar, but below inside the page, You know, you about the page what it is, and then, basically, you can have a menu or something. So people can connect one of the menu could be all the career coaches, right? So it can have a photographer and feel about a person and

[70] Kush Bhatia:
    um,

[71] You:
    We can talk about a little bit about, you know, their background for example and

[72] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay, okay, no problem. No problem.

[73] You:
    we'll have a migration person, migration agent then gtm you know. So but the way it will happen it, we can partner with other people, right? So, everybody who

[74] Kush Bhatia:
    Mmm.

[75] You:
    lands on job Gen, they can see these are our partners and this, please

[76] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[77] You:
    basically, you know, it's helping them to reach to their business and it's

[78] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[79] You:
    basically helping each other. So, that's the page. We also need just very simple page, but design it. You're not like find Is any partnership pages? They are. But you in my mind I'm telling you, right? Like, it's

[80] Kush Bhatia:
    I get it. I get it.

[81] You:
    Important jobs in dot EI, for example, good.

[82] Kush Bhatia:
    Mmm. Good job Green Day. Yeah, yeah.

[83] You:
    Yeah. Go down. Scroll down.

[84] Kush Bhatia:
    oh,

[85] You:
    Maybe go to let's say. Home Button Home? Oh, click Job gen.i where the name is

[86] Kush Bhatia:
    Okay.

[87] You:
    the No just name other jobs and yes go scroll down.

[88] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah, let's go down and

[89] You:
    And if you go at the bottom, you will see their privacy policy. The bottom, the bottom right hand corner.

[90] Kush Bhatia:
    oh,

[91] You:
    I'm going down, keep on going down. Keep on going down the bottom. You see

[92] Kush Bhatia:
    Good, you know? Yeah.

[93] You:
    company below below. Keep on going a price.

[94] Kush Bhatia:
    This one is my privacy, right? Okay.

[95] You:
    Think about something like this, I'm not sure. This is like how you see terms and condition if you go up. So there's terms and condition privacy. So there would be like a of course there would be a more beautiful version, this is like crap, you know, but they will beautiful version and then you can have

[96] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

[97] You:
    We can have like, you know, like a career mentors, you know, career, coaches,

[98] Kush Bhatia:
    migration agents Generally we can classify different kind of people and listing of them.

[99] You:
    Yeah. Yeah.

[100] Kush Bhatia:
    This is just to help other people. Get some business from the people who is coming to option.

[101] You:
    Maybe put it in logo their logo, right? Yeah.

[102] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah. But think about the career coaches, then inspired it would be a photo of a

[103] You:
    Yeah.

[104] Kush Bhatia:
    person, their brand, their company, who they are all the stuff. So I have some content, but I have to put android like so if you can

[105] You:
    Yeah.

[106] Kush Bhatia:
    Put it, I will then flick it to what's the name to that developer so that he can do it.

[107] You:
    Okay, okay.

[108] Kush Bhatia:
    so because this is also a possible, you know, if you can, you know,

[109] You:

[116] Kush Bhatia:
    Yeah.

[117] You:
    are you. I didn't bother you.

[118] Kush Bhatia:
    You should have come to me and said, Hello, what did you do? I wouldn't give it your T-shirt as well and God you there as well.

[119] You:
    Already. Because I saw that you team. I recorded something so so I didn't follow

[120] Kush Bhatia:
    We're gonna part of the team, right? But you recently joined that you were not

[121] You:
    you.

[122] Kush Bhatia:
    on top of my mind, right? Like so these people have been working for quite some time, right? So we decided to do, we are doing a video for start made video, so

[123] You:
    oh,

[124] Kush Bhatia:
    that's why we were there. But next time, if I, you see me come because you are part of the team, right? So you already started, what part of you? If you would

[125] You:
    Okay, okay.

[126] Kush Bhatia:
    have said, hello, I would have taken, not only given your T-shirt, got you into pizza. We had pizzazz. We had even went to Opera Bar had drinks over there. So Here with us.

[127] You:
    Okay.

[128] Kush Bhatia:
    Because you're part of the team, right? Like so you will probably take you with

[129] You:
    Yeah. Okay.

[130] Kush Bhatia:
    us.

[131] You:
    Okay.

[132] Kush Bhatia:
    Even got three cars as well. You're not to take everybody from Uniswah.

[133] You:
    Yeah. Okay. So so the, your team, most of them have come from you and I stop you like, yes.

[134] Kush Bhatia:
    So yeah, like all over the place so they're at least half of the team is from Unsw.

[135] You:
    oh,

[136] Kush Bhatia:
    Including myself, I'm from units of blue and then they are around four, five, four, five, five students are from Unsw and then of course, there are people from, you know, there are other five are, you know more? Yeah, people 20 years, experience, 15 years, experience, all that. So think about half of the team is

[137] You:
    Yeah.

[138] Kush Bhatia:
    young and half of the team is 10. Plus he has experience but you For real, like none of all good. All good, anything else? Lucas I can do for

[139] You:
    No, I just started my report. All right.

[140] Kush Bhatia:
    you? So a look at what I will also do. I'm just thinking out loud, there is another guy called Edwin. So he is from units of Blue. Only somebody reached out to me,

[141] You:
    Yeah.

[142] Kush Bhatia:
    ask me as a favorite and I You know what we call. Because I'm just thinking out, you know, like because normally how I find these intensive works if you are in a group together, right? What

[143] You:
    Yeah. Yeah.

[144] Kush Bhatia:
    He wanted to do was wanted to do a project management itself. You know, like so he wanted to look at the product, like, how very similar what you're doing as a UX design, but you have much more, You know, I would say, expertise on Ux and this he is looking for more from project management side. So one of the person only reach out to me and say Kush. He's a local student. He said, Can you please help him? So even though I didn't knew this guy, but, you know, somebody asks you somebody needs help and they've been jobs that we help them. So, he's working with us. I was thinking either I combine you with that girl because normally, you know, I have preferred to combine group, you know. So that you

[145] You:
    No worries. Yeah.

[146] Kush Bhatia:
    So tell me what, so you have Ux knowledge, what else, you know, Lucas you are interested in to, you know, only yourself, you know.

[147] You:
    Yeah. actually, yeah, actually, I'm quite interested on like front-end design, and, like, API designs because that, that what I did in last year, So I think I'm yeah, I'm familiar with this part and the UI UX design. I actually I didn't like learn it the yet. I just like you told me how to like make some advice on your website. So I just watch some UIs. Design videos on YouTube and started Joe. Yeah.

[148] Kush Bhatia:
    You will. So, tell me Lucas where you want to land next, right? Like, so, okay, there is a case that we will have enough money to support you. We might even give you offer, right? Like, if you're working, because look, all these people who are working with us, they have the first ride, right, because they are here. When Job, Jen was nothing, right? Or we were just starting, right? So, they always will have the first right to work with us. Get some, you know, like the first offers and everything, right. But

[149] You:
    Yeah. Yeah.

[150] Kush Bhatia:
    You tell me what you want to achieve. So that at least you know, like in the second option could be that. What if, you know you want to use this experience and get it into, you know, other companies. So people right at dinner, they we are technically our job at Job, Gen is also to help people to get the job,

[151] You:
    Yeah.

[152] Kush Bhatia:
    right? So that is our motive, you know? So we have 100% committed for it. So, so tell us how I can help you to get those skill set. So so that it can work both for you. If Job Gen is the best place for you to work and we have enough money to keep you going and pay your full time. We will get that option done or if they is or get you in that stage that coming out of uni you are in a perfect

[153] You:
    December. December About? Yeah, I did December 15th.

[154] Kush Bhatia:
    stage to go and, you know, pitch yourself, tell yourself and get out the job. When are you graduating as well? Okay. Okay. Lucas then we need to be hurry up. So Lucas also, as I said to you, you can keep job your name as long as it takes. You can even keep on working with us, right. Like, so sitting just sitting at home and applying job makes

[155] You:
    Yeah.

[156] Kush Bhatia:
    anybody. You're not like very demotivated, so

[157] You:
    Hmm.

[158] Kush Bhatia:
    You know, like you continue whatever you prefer but happy you keep, you know, push your job in even if you want show six months internship or you know, work, so then at least your profile get bit more lifted, right, I will back you up. I will give all the reference. You want use any job you're applying copy their job description, put on your CV and say That's exactly what you did in Job, Gen.

[159] You:
    Okay.

[160] Kush Bhatia:
    And I will back you up if you support but tell me what skill set you would like

[161] You:
    Okay, so

[162] Kush Bhatia:
    to do up.

[163] You:
    Yeah, the guy have some like a from inner design front in the developed job or back in the develop job. I can do this kind of jokes because I'm focused on Web development. Yeah,

[164] Kush Bhatia:
    I think Lucas, I have a perfect rule for you, so that's good at least because if I tell you, I'm just thinking out loud, you know, but and for company you can use cursor and windsurf or or Claude or anything as much as you want, we don't care. You know that you have to

[165] You:
    No limits, right?

[166] Kush Bhatia:
    you do as much as you want, you know, use

[167] You:
    Okay. Okay. That's good.

[168] Kush Bhatia:
    Yes, if you not using because only university has a problem. As a company, you will use it. If you don't use it, then you wasting time.

[169] You:
    Okay.

[170] Kush Bhatia:
    To use as much as you want. I think in that case, I think I have Absolutely, you know, like I'm just thinking out loud, you know, maybe even slowly start looking into that because Lucas look the whole job Gen website that has been built right now.

[171] You:
    Yeah.

[172] Kush Bhatia:
    In build, you know, on a platform called bubble in some part of it has been done on render but that's, you know, we like to get out from here and start, you know. So even if I'm saying because, you know, like one of the things you can do after today and tomorrow part, Look at each of the upgrade, you can even start either. You're not rebuilding in terms of, you know, you can take this, use AI, you want to code, but start

[173] You:
    Yeah.

[174] Kush Bhatia:
    building into, you know, into a server-based project.

[175] You:
    Yeah, I can't do this. I can't do it. Yeah.

[176] Kush Bhatia:
    Because I would love that and Lucas and think about Lucas. By doing this you would anyway. Become like a very crucial person in the team. Yeah.

[177] You:
    Okay.

[178] Kush Bhatia:
    Lucas, um, I think that's definitely less. How about we do start with that, you know?

[179] You:
    Yeah, I can't do this. Yeah.

[180] Kush Bhatia:
    Take any page by page, but converted first, you know, like build your US design, how you think more can be better and then, yeah.

[181] You:
    Three. I Have started right now. You can see. This is the page. I reviewed it.

[182] Kush Bhatia:
    Oh awesome. It looks beautiful.

[183] You:
    Job Tracker Page. Yeah, I reviewed this whole page and I like to, like, show you. Yeah.

[184] Kush Bhatia:
    On if this is legend, this is legend. This is really good anything just because

[185] You:
    Yeah.

[186] Kush Bhatia:
    at some point I have to go and fix this pages.

[187] You:
    Yeah, okay. So, you know, the first, I I get into our page like this job, Tracker page. I feel a little bit of weird, you know, but I can't experience. No express it. So after I learned, yeah.

[188] Kush Bhatia:
    Man you didn't awesome job. Awesome job because you did honestly completely take it to the next level.

[189] You:
    So I like I learned some more UI US design from the video. So I like I realized the deathbedding comes from this this column because this there has so much like different colors between the whole Web page like red blue. And a whole whole column is this the kind of color so I? Yeah.

[190] Kush Bhatia:
    Well, I I love it. How about you send me the screenshot of this as well? Let me take it, but it's a great job. It's absolutely legend work. I think only the

[191] You:
    Okay. so,

[192] Kush Bhatia:
    link where I can run if it is on local text on this one, but looks absolutely stunning. So, Think about you can even start looking page by page and even building this like how you've already done it. You can start you know into

[193] You:
    Okay. So yeah, I also build a list of you like this that is a cartwheel, the cardio. But in our website we didn't develop this yet, right? And yeah, this is carvale.
